useful docker files

## Firefox in a docker container.

Start firfox fresh, destroy all cookies etc on exit. Usefull when you want to visit e.g. facebook.com and not keep its cookies, or visit your online banking site and not fear that some extension steals your password etc.

See the [Dockerfile](docker-firefox/Dockerfile) for instructions on how to build the image and run it.
